# Useful keywords:

# break: Breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop
# continue: Goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop
# pass: Does nothing at all

# pass: Useful for comments, to avoid syntax errors, it does nothing

x = [1, 2, 3]
for item in x:

    pass

# continue: skips and goes to the next item

for letter in mystring:

# breaks: breaks the loop and stops it

for letter in mystring:
    if letter == 'a':
        break
    print(letter)
